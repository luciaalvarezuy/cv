    As a data scientist with a background in psychology, my research bridges
    behavioral science and data-driven decision-making. 
    

    I specialize in the
    analysis of large-scale behavioral datasets to understand how people think,
    feel, and act in real-world contexts. 
    
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg mb-6">
    My academic mission is to translate
    complex psychological constructs—such as future orientation, personality
    traits, and developmental indicators—into measurable data that inform public
    policies and social programs. 
    
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg mb-6">
    I have contributed to international and
    governmental projects in health, education, and early childhood development,
    generating actionable insights through psychometrics, multilevel modeling,
    and machine learning.
