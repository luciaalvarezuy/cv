    abstract: "In this study we explore the possibility that maternal depressive symptomatology and personality would influence parenting practices which would in turn influence their offspring's socio-emotional and cognitive-motor development. We used a large representative sample of Uruguayan children and their mothers. The Big Five Inventory (BFI), subscales of the Home Observation for Measurement of Environment (HOME), Ages & Stages Questionnaires – third edition (n = 3596), Child Behavior Checklist (n = 3750), and a sociodemographic (SES) questionnaire were administered. We found that favorable scores in child development measures were correlated with maternal openness, extraversion, conscientiousness, agreeableness, low neuroticism, depressive symptomatology, positive parenting practices and high income households. We then elaborated pathway models that allowed us to account for covariance between relevant variables. We found that openness was indirectly associated with aspects of both socioemotional and cognitive motor development via parenting practices and maternal depressive symptomatology. The association between SES and both child development outcomes was fully explained by intermediary variables. Collectively, our results provide support for Belsky’s model of child development and can be used by professionals to better target interventions geared at infants and young children and their mothers."

    abstract: "The Ages & Stages Questionnaires: Social–Emotional (ASQ-SE) is a developmental screening test used around the world. However, research assessing the psychometric properties of the Spanish version or in nationally representative samples is scarce. The aim of this study is to evaluate the psychometric properties of ASQ-SE in Spanish, and to characterize the socio-emotional scores by sex and socioeconomic status. We administered the ASQ-SE, the Child Behavior Checklist 1 ½- 5 and the Ages and Stages Questionnaires (3rd version) to a nationally representative sample of children in Uruguay aged 0–3years old. A floor effect was observed in most of the age ranges for ASQ-SE, specifically in the questionnaires for younger infants. Internal consistency was acceptable. The sensitivity and specificity of the instrument was good when using cut-off scores based on the sample of this study rather than on the original United States sample. Boys and children of lower socioeconomic status had more socio-emotional problems. ASQ-SE in Spanish presents a uni-factorial structure with adequate internal consistency, sensitivity, specificity, and criterion validity. ASQ-SE has adequate psychometric properties to detect children whose social and emotional development requires further evaluation or continuous monitoring."

This study examined the factor structure of a Spanish version of the CFCS-14 in Uruguayan and Spanish samples. In Spain data were collected from a sample that completed the CFCS-14 on five consecutive days, which enabled separate analysis of the within-and between-subject factor structure. Simple and multilevel confirmatory factor analysis showed that a two-correlated factor structure provided the best fit to data from both samples and both the within and between-person levels. Further analyses revealed the expected pattern of correlations between CFCS-14 and ZTPI subscales. The results suggest that the Spanish version of the CFCS-14 is reliable and has a robust, two-factor structure. They also suggest that CFCS-14 scores fluctuate over short periods of time."

    abstract: "Measurement of early childhood development at the population level has traditionally been neglected in Latin America. In this context, Uruguay stands out for having two population-based protocols: the Nutrition, Child Development and Health Survey (ENDIS), a home survey, and the School Readiness - Child Development Inventory (INDI). This paper aims to present both assessment experiences and analyse Uruguayan children's cognitive and socioemotional development according to sex and their families' socioeconomic status (SES). Comparisons were made between samples of children aged 1–6. Results suggest that girls generally show better development, except for internalized behaviour, but effect sizes tend to be small. In both surveys, children of high-SES show better development indicators than their low-SES counterparts, with larger effect sizes in fluid intelligence (problem-solving and mathematics). Differences between SES-quintiles consolidate after 30 months of age. Our findings contribute to the development of evidence-based public policies aimed to reduce developmental disparities."

    abstract: "Need for cognition is an important individual difference referring to the tendency to enjoy and engage in effortful cognitive activity. We psychometrically validated a very efficient version of the scale in Spanish with 6 rather than 18 items. Shorter questionnaires are in high demand as they can decrease participant fatigue for example. Questionnaires were administered in Spanish to two independent samples of Uruguayans (N = 367; N = 121). In sample 1, we compared the 18-item version to the 6 hypothesized items, the 6 items with the highest factor loadings and the 12 excluded items. The 6-item version achieved acceptable model fit in confirmatory factor analyses, measurement invariance across fields of study and gender, and performed better than other models in multiple respects. Model fit in sample 2 was even better. Construct validity with external measures (personality, academic motivations, academic performance, consideration of future consequences, work innovation) was upheld in both samples. We discussed subtle differences in correlations and the content of items across versions. ANOVAs suggested that negligible to null differences across gender and field of study. Reliability was acceptable (α = .76) in sample 1 and good in sample 2 (α = .85). In comparison to longer versions, the 6-item version came at little-to-no cost in terms of psychometric properties. Results support its use for comparison between students from different fields and gender. Disposing of this very efficient Need for Cognition Scale in Spanish can encourage its widespread use and in high-stakes assessments of the predictors of performance in higher education and the workplace."

Recent research has shown that there are different time attitude profiles based on different configurations of the six Adolescent and Adult Time Inventory-Time Attitude (AATI-TA) subscales. The objective of this study was to analyze the psychometric properties of AATI-TA scores in Uruguay and determine the existence of temporal profiles in this context. Participants were a convenience sample of 446 (36.5% males) adults in Uruguay with a mean age of 34.53 years (SD = 13.17, range 18-75 years). Participants completed a sociodemographic questionnaire, the AATI-TA, and questionnaires on intentions, behaviors, and attitudes towards healthy food consumption and physical activity. AATI-TA scores had good reliabilities (> .70). The six-factor solution was supported and invariance by gender and age group was established. We identified five profiles - Resilients, High Positives, Negatives, Present Negatives, and Moderate Positives - which were associated differently with healthy food consumption patterns. Negative profiles were related to higher levels of unhealthy food consumption."

This study aimed to analyse the psychometric properties of the Spanish version of the CBCL in a representative sample of children from Uruguay (n = 4210), identify latent profiles and characterise profiles according to sociodemographic and family environment variables (maternal depression and violence practices). Our results suggest that the CBCL 1½–5 is reliable. We replicate the seven-correlated-factor solution, which is invariant by sex and age. Three large profiles of behavioural problems were identified (high, medium and low risk) where membership in groups of higher risk was explained by the socioeconomic context, child’s sex, maternal depression and, to a lesser extent, violent parental practices."

    abstract: "The Consideration of Future Consequences is a personality trait that measures the extent to which people weigh the immediate versus the distant results of their actions and the degree to which they are influenced by them. The aim of this master's thesis was to validate the Consideration of the Future Consequences Scale of 14 items (CFCS-14) in Spanish. For this purpose, we conducted three studies with different samples of Uruguayans participants (N study 1= 679; N study 2=180; N study 3= 309).  In the first study, we assessed the reliability and factor structure of the scale through an exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis. Secondly, we evaluated the temporal stability of the CFCS-14 with a four to five weeks test-retest. Finally, in the third study we examined its validity in relation with these variables: body mass index, physical activity and healthy diet. For this, we estimated the correlation coefficients, tested a structural equation model and carried out a multiple regression analysis. Finally, it was explored its convergent and divergent validity with three scales that measure temporal psychology variables by estimating its correlation coefficients. The results of this study support the idea that the CFCS-14 in Spanish is composed of two correlated factors. The two dimensions presented good reliability with Cronbach's alpha and McDonald's Omega greater than .70. We also found evidence of temporal stability of the scores, although some items presented low coefficients. The subscale Consideration of Future Consequences with Immediate consequences moderately predicts healthy eating, physical activity and body mass index. In contrast, the subscale Consideration of Future Consequences with Future consequences is not related to any of the health variables studied. Finally, in this study the CFCS-14 presented appropriate convergent and divergent validity with the Zimbardo's Time Perspective Inventory, Time Attitude Scale and Temporal Discounting rate. In sum, the CFCS-14 is suitable for its use in research even though its subscales present differences in their practical utility related to human health variables."

    abstract: "Consideration of future consequences (CFC) was originally proposed to be a stable personality trait that describes the degree to which individuals consider the immediate versus distant results of their actions. Recent studies debate whether CFC fluctuates over short periods of time and whether it is a domain-specific construct. The present study aims to explore the fluctuation of CFC scale scores over a weekly interval and explore how this variability is associated with three relevant outcomes. For this purpose, the general CFC scale was adapted to three domain-specific scales: health, academic, and work. A total of 737 adults (Mage = 36.58, SD = 14.73) participated and completed the questionnaires over eight waves of data collection separated by one week. The results indicate that CFC scale scores fluctuates at weekly intervals. Healthy eating, academic engagement, and innovation at work at the intra-individual level were associated with fluctuations in the corresponding domain-specific scales over and above the general CFC scale. The results suggest that CFC is, to some extent, variable within short periods of time. Furthermore, we found evidence in favour of the reliability and validity of all CFC scales in Spanish used in this study. These findings may be useful for public policies that depend on people's future orientation."

We focus the analysis on the 2018 cohort, and we find that both services present population singularities, both regarding the characteristics of the students who enroll, as well as the factors that affect their trajectories, represented in the decisions to leave the Service. The sample survey of trajectories, asking for permanence or dropout, was carried out during 2019, when the students should be studying their second year in their respective faculty. We found that, in addition to sociodemographic characteristics of students, personality traits and fluid intelligence also influence dropout decisions. In particular, the mediator of intention and behavior to personality characteristics, as well as fluid intelligence (measured through Raven's Progressive Matrices), are negatively related to dropout in both services."

Por ejemplo, los estudiantes universitarios habitualmente deben decidir si salen un fin de semana con sus amigos (lo cual les brinda satisfacción y placer inmediato) o se quedan en su hogar estudiando (acción que conllevaría mayor probabilidad de aprobar futuras evaluaciones). Para comprender y explicar cómo las personas resuelven los dilemas temporales Strathman, Gleicher, Boninger, y Edwards (1994) propusieron el constructo Consideración de las Consecuencias Futuras (ccf). Desde este constructo se considera que las personas resuelven los dilemas temporales eligiendo y prefiriendo ya sea las consecuencias inmediatas o las distantes de sus comportamientos (Strathman, Gleicher, Boninger y Edwards, 1994). La ccf define el grado en que las personas sopesan y son influenciadas por los resultados inmediatos y distantes de sus acciones. Aunque es propuesta como un rasgo de personalidad estable en el tiempo puede variar a lo largo del ciclo vital de los seres humanos (Strathman et al., 1994). Por ejemplo, si una persona de bajos recursos gana la lotería podría dejar de preocuparse por los resultados inmediatos de sus acciones (organizarse para llegar a fin de mes) y pasar a enfocarse en las consecuencias distantes (por ejemplo, dónde va a construir su casa o qué va a hacer en vacaciones)."

Este trabajo examina la relación entre los rasgos de la personalidad en el modelo de los cinco grandes (big five en inglés), la consideración de las consecuencias futuras y la inteligencia fluida, en las decisiones de abandono escolar entre estudiantes de segundo año de las facultades de Ciencias Económicas y de Administración y Psicología de la Universidad de la República. Utilizamos información de una muestra de la cohorte 2018 para analizar los patrones de abandono a través de modelos de variable dependiente cualitativa. Nuestros hallazgos revelan que los rasgos de personalidad y la inteligencia fluida están significativamente asociados con las decisiones de abandono escolar, aunque sus efectos varían según la disciplina académica. Además, identificamos patrones distintos de influencia de los rasgos de personalidad y las habilidades cognitivas en las tipologías de abandono instruccional y sistémico.

    abstract: "The consideration of future consequences scale (CFCS) is a widely used instrument to assess how individuals resolve dilemmas referring to actions with immediate and distant rewards. This work aims to introduce and explore the initial psychometric versions of the 10- and 8-item abbreviated versions of the CFCS in Spanish and its adaptations for specific domains. The studies were conducted: In Study 1, 1095 adults completed the CFCS-14 the Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory and the Adolescent and Adult Time Inventory – Time Attitudes. In Study 2, 738 adults completed the domain-free CFCS and some of the domain-specific adaptations to health-related behaviors and work. Results in Study 1 revealed acceptable to very good indicators of reliability, factor solution and convergent validity of the abbreviated CFCS versions. Furthermore, in Study 2, these results were extended to the domain-specific versions. Correlations with behavioral outcomes were, in general, substantially larger for the scores yielded by the domain-specific compared to the general CFCS. Our results suggest that the shorter versions of the CFCS could be used safely by researchers. Future research on the domain-specificity of the construct is required."
