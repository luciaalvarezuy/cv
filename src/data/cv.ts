    abstract: "Consideration of Future Consequences (CFC) is a construct of subjective temporality that describes to what extent individuals consider and are influenced by the immediate and future consequences of their actions. Initially, CFC was conceived as a stable individual difference over time, applicable generally across various contexts. However, recent research suggests that CFC levels may vary over time and across specific domains. The main objective of this doctoral thesis is to explore the inter- and intraindividual variations in CFC, using the general scale and its versions adapted to specific domains. Furthermore, the associations between CFC scores with well-being and health-related behaviours are analysed. To achieve this, three empirical studies were conducted with different samples. In the first study, 737 participants completed weekly assessments to examine the weekly fluctuations of CFC and its relationship with variables related to health behaviours, education, and work. In the second study, two independent samples were used, consisting of 371 and 367 participants, respectively. This study explored inter- and intra-individual differences in CFC across the domains of health, physical activity, healthy eating, and work. Associations between latent CFC profiles and decision making in these areas are also examined. In the third study, 60 romantic couples participated, aiming to investigate the daily fluctuations of CFC and its relationship with relationship well-being. The study also evaluated the associations between individual CFC levels and similarity between partners. Additionally, the moderating effect of similarity in the relationship between individual CFC and relationship well-being is examined. From a cross-sectional perspective, the psychometric properties of all the CFC scales used in the studies are assessed. The findings of Studies 1 and 3 suggest that CFC scores fluctuate on a weekly and daily basis, respectively. The latent profile analysis in Study 2 identified congruent and incongruent profiles across specific domains. This indicates that some individuals report consistent CFC levels, whether immediate or future, across various areas of their lives. Conversely, others report opposing CFC levels depending on the specific domain evaluated, such as health and work. These findings confirm that CFC scores vary according to the domain assessed. In all three studies, the immediate subscale of the CFC is negatively associated with well-being and health-related behaviors, whereas the future subscale is positively related. The results confirm that future-oriented CFC promotes well-being and health, whereas immediate-oriented CFC may have a negative effect. Furthermore, in Study 3, the importance of individual scores on the CFC and their similarity between romantic partners for relationship well-being is highlighted. It is also observed that greater similarity can moderate the negative effects of immediate CFC and enhance the benefits of future CFC. Regarding the psychometric properties, evidence was obtained of adequate reliability and validity of the CFC scales, both in their general format and in their adapted and abbreviated versions. In synthesis, this doctoral thesis presents evidence on the inter- and intraindividual differences of the CFC in its general format and scales adapted to specific domains. The results confirm that CFC exhibits consistent associations with variables related to well-being and health. Additionally, the findings demonstrate that all applied CFC scales possess adequate psychometric properties."

    abstract: "In this study we explore the possibility that maternal depressive symptomatology and personality would influence parenting practices which would in turn influence their offspring's socio-emotional and cognitive-motor development. We used a large representative sample of Uruguayan children and their mothers. The Big Five Inventory (BFI), subscales of the Home Observation for Measurement of Environment (HOME), Ages & Stages Questionnaires – third edition (n = 3596), Child Behavior Checklist (n = 3750), and a sociodemographic (SES) questionnaire were administered. We found that favorable scores in child development measures were correlated with maternal openness, extraversion, conscientiousness, agreeableness, low neuroticism, depressive symptomatology, positive parenting practices and high income households. We then elaborated pathway models that allowed us to account for covariance between relevant variables. We found that openness was indirectly associated with aspects of both socioemotional and cognitive motor development via parenting practices and maternal depressive symptomatology. The association between SES and both child development outcomes was fully explained by intermediary variables. Collectively, our results provide support for Belsky’s model of child development and can be used by professionals to better target interventions geared at infants and young children and their mothers."

    abstract: "The Ages & Stages Questionnaires: Social–Emotional (ASQ-SE) is a developmental screening test used around the world. However, research assessing the psychometric properties of the Spanish version or in nationally representative samples is scarce. The aim of this study is to evaluate the psychometric properties of ASQ-SE in Spanish, and to characterize the socio-emotional scores by sex and socioeconomic status. We administered the ASQ-SE, the Child Behavior Checklist 1 ½- 5 and the Ages and Stages Questionnaires (3rd version) to a nationally representative sample of children in Uruguay aged 0–3years old. A floor effect was observed in most of the age ranges for ASQ-SE, specifically in the questionnaires for younger infants. Internal consistency was acceptable. The sensitivity and specificity of the instrument was good when using cut-off scores based on the sample of this study rather than on the original United States sample. Boys and children of lower socioeconomic status had more socio-emotional problems. ASQ-SE in Spanish presents a uni-factorial structure with adequate internal consistency, sensitivity, specificity, and criterion validity. ASQ-SE has adequate psychometric properties to detect children whose social and emotional development requires further evaluation or continuous monitoring."

    abstract: "The factor structure of the Consideration of Future Consequences Scale (CFCS-14) is currently subject to debate and little is known about its temporal stability, or indeed whether temporal changes affect the factor structure. This study examined the factor structure of a Spanish version of the CFCS-14 in Uruguayan and Spanish samples. In Spain data were collected from a sample that completed the CFCS-14 on five consecutive days, which enabled separate analysis of the within-and between-subject factor structure. Simple and multilevel confirmatory factor analysis showed that a two-correlated factor structure provided the best fit to data from both samples and both the within and between-person levels. Further analyses revealed the expected pattern of correlations between CFCS-14 and ZTPI subscales. The results suggest that the Spanish version of the CFCS-14 is reliable and has a robust, two-factor structure. They also suggest that CFCS-14 scores fluctuate over short periods of time."

    abstract: "Background: The Ages & Stages Questionnaires Third Version (ASQ-3) identifies the risk of developmental delay in children aged 2 to 66 months. The ASQ-3 is available in many languages. However, there is little evidence of the psychometric properties of the Spanish version and using nationally-representative samples. Aims: This study evaluates the reliability and factor solution of the Spanish version of the ASQ-3 (18- to 54-month questionnaires) in a large, representative sample of Uruguayan children. Besides, it explores the association of ASQ-3 scores with sociodemographic characteristics. Method: Participants were 4016 main caregivers selected randomly across the country who completed the ASQ-3 for their children. All participants responded to the ASQ-3 and a sociodemographic questionnaire within the context of a government-run survey of child development. Results: Most versions of the ASQ-3 in Spanish have acceptable-to-good psychometric properties, supporting the 5-factor-solution. Personal-Social and, to a lesser extent, Problem-solving scores were the subscales that showed more suboptimal internal consistency coefficients. Scores showed higher ceiling effects than the original US sample but varied across domains, with Gross Motor showing the highest pattern. Sex and socioeconomic status are associated with scores of most age-versions and subscales of the ASQ-3. Conclusions: In general, results support the reliability and dimensionality of ASQ-3 scores, but psychometric properties varied across age-version and domains. Overall, earlier versions presented less precision, while the Personal-social domain showed reduced reliability in most age-versions."

In this context, Uruguay stands out for having two population-based protocols: the Nutrition, Child Development and Health Survey (ENDIS), a home survey, and the School Readiness - Child Development Inventory (INDI). This paper aims to present both assessment experiences and analyse Uruguayan children's cognitive and socioemotional development according to sex and their families' socioeconomic status (SES). Comparisons were made between samples of children aged 1–6. Results suggest that girls generally show better development, except for internalized behaviour, but effect sizes tend to be small. In both surveys, children of high-SES show better development indicators than their low-SES counterparts, with larger effect sizes in fluid intelligence (problem-solving and mathematics). Differences between SES-quintiles consolidate after 30 months of age. Our findings contribute to the development of evidence-based public policies aimed to reduce developmental disparities."

    abstract: "Need for cognition is an important individual difference referring to the tendency to enjoy and engage in effortful cognitive activity. We psychometrically validated a very efficient version of the scale in Spanish with 6 rather than 18 items. Shorter questionnaires are in high demand as they can decrease participant fatigue for example. Questionnaires were administered in Spanish to two independent samples of Uruguayans (N = 367; N = 121). In sample 1, we compared the 18-item version to the 6 hypothesized items, the 6 items with the highest factor loadings and the 12 excluded items. The 6-item version achieved acceptable model fit in confirmatory factor analyses, measurement invariance across fields of study and gender, and performed better than other models in multiple respects. Model fit in sample 2 was even better. Construct validity with external measures (personality, academic motivations, academic performance, consideration of future consequences, work innovation) was upheld in both samples. We discussed subtle differences in correlations and the content of items across versions. ANOVAs suggested that negligible to null differences across gender and field of study. Reliability was acceptable (α = .76) in sample 1 and good in sample 2 (α = .85). In comparison to longer versions, the 6-item version came at little-to-no cost in terms of psychometric properties. Results support its use for comparison between students from different fields and gender. Disposing of this very efficient Need for Cognition Scale in Spanish can encourage its widespread use and in high-stakes assessments of the predictors of performance in higher education and the workplace."

Participants completed a sociodemographic questionnaire, the AATI-TA, and questionnaires on intentions, behaviors, and attitudes towards healthy food consumption and physical activity. AATI-TA scores had good reliabilities (> .70). The six-factor solution was supported and invariance by gender and age group was established. We identified five profiles - Resilients, High Positives, Negatives, Present Negatives, and Moderate Positives - which were associated differently with healthy food consumption patterns. Negative profiles were related to higher levels of unhealthy food consumption."

    abstract: "The Consideration of Future Consequences is a personality trait that measures the extent to which people weigh the immediate versus the distant results of their actions and the degree to which they are influenced by them. The aim of this master's thesis was to validate the Consideration of the Future Consequences Scale of 14 items (CFCS-14) in Spanish. For this purpose, we conducted three studies with different samples of Uruguayans participants (N study 1= 679; N study 2=180; N study 3= 309).  In the first study, we assessed the reliability and factor structure of the scale through an exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis. Secondly, we evaluated the temporal stability of the CFCS-14 with a four to five weeks test-retest. Finally, in the third study we examined its validity in relation with these variables: body mass index, physical activity and healthy diet. For this, we estimated the correlation coefficients, tested a structural equation model and carried out a multiple regression analysis. Finally, it was explored its convergent and divergent validity with three scales that measure temporal psychology variables by estimating its correlation coefficients. The results of this study support the idea that the CFCS-14 in Spanish is composed of two correlated factors. The two dimensions presented good reliability with Cronbach's alpha and McDonald's Omega greater than .70. We also found evidence of temporal stability of the scores, although some items presented low coefficients. The subscale Consideration of Future Consequences with Immediate consequences moderately predicts healthy eating, physical activity and body mass index. In contrast, the subscale Consideration of Future Consequences with Future consequences is not related to any of the health variables studied. Finally, in this study the CFCS-14 presented appropriate convergent and divergent validity with the Zimbardo's Time Perspective Inventory, Time Attitude Scale and Temporal Discounting rate. In sum, the CFCS-14 is suitable for its use in research even though its subscales present differences in their practical utility related to human health variables."

    abstract: "Consideration of future consequences (CFC) was originally proposed to be a stable personality trait that describes the degree to which individuals consider the immediate versus distant results of their actions. Recent studies debate whether CFC fluctuates over short periods of time and whether it is a domain-specific construct. The present study aims to explore the fluctuation of CFC scale scores over a weekly interval and explore how this variability is associated with three relevant outcomes. For this purpose, the general CFC scale was adapted to three domain-specific scales: health, academic, and work. A total of 737 adults (Mage = 36.58, SD = 14.73) participated and completed the questionnaires over eight waves of data collection separated by one week. The results indicate that CFC scale scores fluctuates at weekly intervals. Healthy eating, academic engagement, and innovation at work at the intra-individual level were associated with fluctuations in the corresponding domain-specific scales over and above the general CFC scale. The results suggest that CFC is, to some extent, variable within short periods of time. Furthermore, we found evidence in favour of the reliability and validity of all CFC scales in Spanish used in this study. These findings may be useful for public policies that depend on people's future orientation."

    abstract: "This research focus into the analysis of the relationship between personality traits and fluid intelligence with the decisions to drop out of students from the Public University of Economics and Psychology, of Uruguay (Universidad de la República). We focus the analysis on the 2018 cohort, and we find that both services present population singularities, both regarding the characteristics of the students who enroll, as well as the factors that affect their trajectories, represented in the decisions to leave the Service. The sample survey of trajectories, asking for permanence or dropout, was carried out during 2019, when the students should be studying their second year in their respective faculty. We found that, in addition to sociodemographic characteristics of students, personality traits and fluid intelligence also influence dropout decisions. In particular, the mediator of intention and behavior to personality characteristics, as well as fluid intelligence (measured through Raven's Progressive Matrices), are negatively related to dropout in both services."

    "abstract": "Every day we make decisions in which we must weigh the immediate and distant consequences of our actions. For example, university students often need to decide whether to go out with friends for the weekend (which offers immediate satisfaction and pleasure) or stay home studying (an action that would increase their chances of passing future exams). To understand and explain how people resolve temporal dilemmas, Strathman, Gleicher, Boninger, and Edwards (1994) proposed the construct of Consideration of Future Consequences (CFC). This construct posits that people resolve temporal dilemmas by choosing and favoring either the immediate or distant outcomes of their behavior. CFC defines the extent to which individuals weigh and are influenced by the immediate and distant results of their actions. Although proposed as a stable personality trait over time, it may vary throughout the human life cycle (Strathman et al., 1994). For example, if a person with low income wins the lottery, they might stop worrying about the immediate consequences of their actions (such as budgeting to make ends meet) and start focusing on distant consequences (e.g., where to build a house or what to do on vacation)."

    abstract: "Personality traits, other psychological characteristics, and cognitive abilities have been consistently linked to academic performance. However, there is limited empirical evidence on how these factors jointly influence school dropout decisions. This study examines the relationship between personality traits based on the Big Five model, consideration of future consequences, and fluid intelligence in relation to dropout decisions among second-year students from the Faculties of Economics and Administration and Psychology at the University of the Republic (Uruguay). We used data from a sample of the 2018 cohort to analyze dropout patterns using qualitative dependent variable models. Our findings reveal that personality traits and fluid intelligence are significantly associated with dropout decisions, although their effects vary across academic disciplines. In addition, we identified distinct patterns of influence of personality traits and cognitive abilities on different types of dropout: instructional and systemic. These findings contribute to the growing literature on the psychological determinants of educational outcomes and offer insights for higher education policies aimed at improving student retention."

    abstract: "The consideration of future consequences scale (CFCS) is a widely used instrument to assess how individuals resolve dilemmas referring to actions with immediate and distant rewards. This work aims to introduce and explore the initial psychometric versions of the 10- and 8-item abbreviated versions of the CFCS in Spanish and its adaptations for specific domains. The studies were conducted: In Study 1, 1095 adults completed the CFCS-14 the Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory and the Adolescent and Adult Time Inventory – Time Attitudes. In Study 2, 738 adults completed the domain-free CFCS and some of the domain-specific adaptations to health-related behaviors and work. Results in Study 1 revealed acceptable to very good indicators of reliability, factor solution and convergent validity of the abbreviated CFCS versions. Furthermore, in Study 2, these results were extended to the domain-specific versions. Correlations with behavioral outcomes were, in general, substantially larger for the scores yielded by the domain-specific compared to the general CFCS. Our results suggest that the shorter versions of the CFCS could be used safely by researchers. Future research on the domain-specificity of the construct is required."

In a representative sample of Montevideo, the aim of this study is to explore its psychometric properties, establish its population scales, explore its territorial distribution and evaluate the associations of the CFC with the consumption of drugs. In this study, the two-factor solution provides better fit, with adequate reliability. The CFC present significant differences according to age and sex, for which specific scales are offered. Likewise, we found mixed evidence on their territorial distribution and a small effect size on the consumption of some substances. Results are discussed based on the role of the CFC to explain behavior with intertemporal consequences."

    abstract: "Introduction. Consideration of Future Consequences (CFC) is a personality trait that assesses the degree to which individuals weigh the immediate versus distant outcomes of their actions and the extent to which they are influenced by those outcomes (Strathman, Gleicher, Boninger, & Edwards, 1994). It has been shown that CFC is significantly and negatively associated with Body Mass Index (BMI) (Adams & Nettle, 2009; Adams & White, 2009). Additionally, CFC has been reported to mediate the relationship between BMI and monthly income (Adams & White, 2009). Adams (2012) indicated that the CFC-Immediate subscale is positively and significantly associated with BMI, whereas the CFC-Future subscale is not. Objective: To examine the influence of CFC on the relationship between net monthly income and BMI. To this end, a mediation-moderation model is tested in which both CFC subscales—CFC-Immediate (CFC-I) and CFC-Future (CFC-F)—mediate the relationship between net monthly income and BMI. Additionally, the study explores whether education (dichotomized into university students and non-university students) moderates the relationship between CFC and BMI. Methodology: The study used a sample of 309 participants, of whom 216 were university students and the rest were not. The mean age of participants was 34.17 years (SD = 13.39), with 66% identifying as women. Participants completed a sociodemographic questionnaire and the Spanish-adapted CFC Scale. A dichotomous variable for education was created: one category included current or former university students, and the other included individuals with no university education. Results: The model controlled for age, gender, and self-perceived general health. The direct effect of net monthly income on BMI was negative but not statistically significant (β = -0.077; p = .730). However, the relationship between net monthly income and the mediating variable was β = -0.186 (p = .005). A negative mediation effect of CFC-I on the relationship between net monthly income and BMI was found, moderated by educational background. This pattern was observed only among non-university participants (β = 0.129; Bootstrapped LLICI = 0.000 to Bootstrapped ULCI = 0.316). These analyses were repeated using CFC-F instead of CFC-I, but no statistically significant results were found. Discussion: Some results are consistent with prior studies in this area. The findings suggest that education moderates the relationship between net monthly income and BMI as mediated by CFC-I, but only among non-university individuals. Moreover, this study highlights the importance of psychological variables, such as Consideration of Future Consequences, in the link between net income and BMI. It suggests that reflection on the immediate consequences of actions may play a more decisive role in maintaining a lower BMI (possibly linked to healthy behaviors like physical activity and balanced diet) than reflection on long-term consequences. Finally, the results underscore the relevance and importance of conducting studies with non-university populations."
