      <p class="text-lg mb-6">
        My research integrates behavioral science with data-driven methodologies
        to understand how people think, feel, and act in real-world settings. I
        specialize in analyzing large-scale psychological and social
        datasets—using tools such as multilevel modeling, structural equation
        modeling, and machine learning—to produce insights that inform public
        policy, education, and health interventions.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-6">
        I have led interdisciplinary projects that translate complex behavioral
        constructs, like future orientation and well-being, into measurable
        indicators that support actionable decision-making. My work is grounded
        in real impact: partnering with public institutions, universities, and
        international organizations to improve social programs and educational
        outcomes.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-6">
        Currently, I work at the intersection of academic research and applied
        data science, combining big data analytics, behavioral modeling, and
        artificial intelligence. I continue to lead interdisciplinary teams,
        design analytic strategies, and publish scientific findings, while also
        applying these methods to business and policy-driven environments to
        support evidence-based decision-making and social innovation.

I co-developed analytic strategies with stakeholders, managed analyst teams, and oversaw all stages from data cleaning to insight communication. This cross-cutting work includes defining research questions, selecting statistical models, ensuring data quality, and communicating results through policy briefs, academic conferences, public radio, and internal reports. These projects reflect my ability to lead collaborative, impact-oriented initiatives with both technical rigor and strategic vision.",

            "Conducted a large-scale longitudinal study (N = 727) to analyze weekly fluctuations in the Consideration of Future Consequences (CFC), using general and domain-specific short-form scales. Conducted multilevel confirmatory factor analysis (MCFA) to validate the structure of the CFC across repeated measures, and computed omega coefficients for inter- and intraindividual reliability. Estimated intra-class correlations (ICCs) to assess temporal stability and variability of CFC scores. Using multilevel regression models with person-centered predictors, I examined how weekly changes in future orientation were associated with healthy eating, academic engagement, and workplace behavior. Additional analyses included one-way ANOVA with Tukey post-hoc tests, descriptive statistics, and Pearson correlations to explore patterns of change over time.",

Assessed intra- and interindividual variability using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) at the day, person, and couple level. Applied multilevel modeling with random intercepts at the couple level to test the effects of individual CFC scores and dyadic similarity on well-being outcomes. Developed and compared nested models to evaluate fixed and interaction effects, including the moderating role of CFC similarity. Controlled for covariates such as age and number of children. Visualized interaction effects to interpret patterns of moderation within dyads.",

Applied Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to test mediation effects and indirect pathways, accounting for covariance among psychological and socioeconomic variables. Controlled for income and other demographic factors to isolate predictors with the highest impact on child outcomes. The findings support data-informed strategies for targeting early developmental interventions.",

Conducted Exploratory and Confirmatory Factor Analyses (EFA/CFA), including multilevel CFA, to test dimensional structure and temporal invariance. Assessed internal consistency using McDonald’s omega and evaluated predictive validity through correlational methods and person-centered approaches such as latent profile analysis.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6">Research Impact</h2>
    <p class="text-lg mb-6">
      Throughout my career, I’ve been driven by the belief that data science can
      be a powerful tool for solving real-world problems and driving social
      change. I’ve applied this mindset in diverse interdisciplinary
      settings—working with governments, international organizations, and
      universities to transform complex data into actionable knowledge.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg mb-6">
      In Uruguay, I collaborated with public institutions and the University of
      the Republic—both within the School of Psychology and across other
      faculties—to improve educational outcomes, evaluate social programs, and
      support data-driven decision-making. I also worked with the Inter-American
      Development Bank, analyzing large-scale datasets to inform evidence-based
      public policy across Latin America.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg mb-6">
      Now based in Spain, I’m involved in projects aimed at tackling
      disinformation, advancing inclusive education, and supporting social
      mobility. This includes training and mentoring individuals—especially
      women and career changers—to develop data literacy and access better job
      opportunities in the digital economy.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg mb-6">
      Across these projects, I’ve led analytical strategies, designed research
      protocols, and delivered insights that have supported institutional
      learning, policy reform, and community development—demonstrating the
      tangible impact that thoughtful data science can achieve.
